Braindump, might be good or bad ideas

- time source:
    - wall time of executing machine, must be combined with --write-only
      because it does not allow for deep read validation

- metrics mode: solve time skew problem:
    - with --write-only mode, using wall time


- maybe add a command line flag allowing for ignoring 'out of order' errors in general


- allow for keeping some streams longer than others, following a certain
  distribution

- for time series generation, allow for a random walk within predictable bounds

- metrics mode: detect when a write would happen into the future, do not crash in this case, but
  adapt to wall time.
