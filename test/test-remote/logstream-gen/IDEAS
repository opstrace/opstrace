Braindump, might be good or bad ideas

- for changing the weight between write and read phase:
    - read validation only for every Nth stream

- a write-only mode (--skip-read or --write-only, ...)

- time source:
    - wall time of executing machine, must be combined with --write-only
      because it does not allow for deep read validation

- metrics mode: solve time skew problem:
    - with --write-only mode, using wall time
    - or with regular checkpoints where the synthetic time source gets
      synced to wall time (when it has fallen _behind_ compared to wall time)
      then these checkpoints can be stored in mem (cheaply) for the deep
      read validation.
