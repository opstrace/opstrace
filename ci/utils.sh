#
# curl is a bash function with the same name as the binary to ensure we always
# call this function instead of the command directly. The purpose is to set a
# few default options in the curl command.
#
# curl manpage section https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html about retry flag:
#
# "If a transient error is returned when curl tries to perform a transfer, it
# will retry this number of times before giving up. Setting the number to 0
# makes curl do no retries (which is the default). Transient error means either:
# a timeout, an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 408 or 5xx response code.
#
# When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first wait one second and then
# for all forthcoming retries it will double the waiting time until it reaches
# 10 minutes which then will be the delay between the rest of the retries. By
# using --retry-delay you disable this exponential backoff algorithm. See also
# --retry-max-time to limit the total time allowed for retries.
#
# Since curl 7.66.0, curl will comply with the Retry-After: response header if
# one was present to know when to issue the next retry.
#
# If this option is used several times, the last one will be used."
