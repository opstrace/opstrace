 *
 * 1. copy the correct yaml
 * 2. covert to json (https://www.convertjson.com/yaml-to-json.htm)
 * 3. paste here
 * 4. `yarn generate-apis` (this will take this CRD and turn it into a KubernetesResource Class that we use in our Typescript).
 *     Output from this command is in https://github.com/opstrace/opstrace/tree/6be8da8aa2db3479d72acb47b0156ff2b04939a2/lib/kubernetes/src/custom-resources directory.
 * 5. it's likely you'll have compiler errors now in packages like the controller, where we now need to update the resource spec
 * 5. adjust any specs that now use the updated resources so they conform to the new spec.
