# GraphQL Client

This directory contains autogenerated Go code for interacting with the internal Hasura GraphQL server, which acts as a proxy for Postgres. A separate handcoded layer on top of that provides access to specific operations like updating entries in Hasura.

The generator configuration is located in [/packages/app/codegen.js](../../../packages/app/codegen.js). The generator can be run as follows:
```
opstrace$ cd packages/app/
packages/app$ yarn && yarn tsc -b # get/build dependencies if not done already
packages/app$ yarn services:start # in one terminal
packages/app$ yarn types:watch    # in a second terminal
```

For more information, see [/packages/app/README.md](../../../packages/app/README.md).
