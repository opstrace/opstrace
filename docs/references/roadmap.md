# Opstrace Roadmap

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

Our early access version provides a foundation that solves many [real pain points](/blog/public-launch-announcement) that people have today.
But we know there is still a lot more to do to have a _complete_ observability platform that is more than just private, secure and cost-effective.
This high-level roadmap highlights major guideposts along our path toward that goal.

**Opstrace Collaborative UI™**

* Today's observability tools are disjoint from the day-to-day development process.
For example, dashboards can break easily with a deploy and sharing analyses is hard (screenshots anyone?).
By integrating your data with code we can solve these existing problems and create new capabilities (think VScode meets Python notebooks).

**First-class Alerts**

* Similarly, alerts shouldn't be a disjoint concept.
Often alerts are left until the end, and usualy wired up through a separate system.
When you write code you _assert_ certain code paths work—alerts should be the same.

**Synthetic Monitoring**

* Reliably receive alerts if some part of your product is not available in some part of the world.

**Tracing**

* Tracing suffers similar problems to logs and metrics–it's expensive to operate and even more difficult to set up.
(Not to mention the GDPR issues of sending your data out to a 3rd party provider.)
It's also hard to set up existing open source tools your own account.
Despite all this, we will provide distributed tracing as a deliberate feature, making it just as easy, secure, and private as logs and metrics.
