# Cluster configuration

For setting up an Opstrace cluster, one has to provide a corresponding configuration document in YAML format.
A minimal variant might look like this:

```yaml
tenants:
    - prod
    - ci
node_count: 3
```

The following sections list individual configuration parameters and aim to provide detailed specification for their purpose and meaning.

At a high level, there are two different types of parameters:

* required ones (you have to set those for creating an Opstrace cluster)
* optional ones (but please do not assume sane defaults yet :-))

**Note:**  as of today, the cluster configuration cannot be updated at runtime.

## Required parameters

### `tenants`

The set of tenants \(their names\) to set up in the Opstrace cluster.
At least one name is required.

*Value type:* list of strings

*Example:*

```yaml
tenants:
    - prod
    - ci
```

### `node_count`

The number of machines this Opstrace cluster is supposed to be comprised of.

*Value type:* number \(integer\)

*Example:*

```yaml
node_count: 3
```

You should explicitly choose the number of machines your Opstrace cluster is comprised of, which is why this is a required parameter for now.

**WARNING:** Here be dragons.
ðŸ˜ˆ
There be dragons when you change this: we develop with three nodes, andâ€”for nowâ€”we rarely test with less or more.

## Optional parameters

<!--tabs-->
### `aws`

Allows for setting infrastructure-related configuration specific to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

*Value type:* flat object

*Example:*

```yaml
aws:
    instance_type: t3.2xlarge
    region: us-west-2
    zone_suffix: a
```

### `gcp`

Allows for setting infrastructure-related configuration specific to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

*Value type:* flat object

*Example:*

```yaml
gcp:
    machine_type: n1-standard-4
    region: us-west2
    zone_suffix: a
```

<!--/tabs-->

Note:

* The example above shows the defaults.
* For now, expect badness when changing the region/zone (cf. issue [1033](opstrace-prelaunch/issues/1033)).


### `env_label`

Specifies a label that is subsequently attached to most cloud resources associated with the Opstrace cluster.

*Default:* not set, not applied

*Value type:* string

*Example:*

```yaml
env_label: ci
```

The label name will be `env`, and the value will be what you provide here.

### `data_api_authentication_disabled`

*Default:* `false` \(the tenant API requires authentication proof\).

*Value type:* boolean

By default, authentication proof is required when accessing the HTTP API for pushing or querying logs/metrics data.
This flag can be used to disable said authentication mechanism, allowing for unauthenticated clients to write or read data.

When required, any HTTP request arriving at the tenant HTTP API is expected to show an API token in an `Authorization` header \(using the `Bearer` scheme\).

Notes:

* When set to `false` \(default\), the Opstrace cluster management CLI creates one long-lived API token per tenant upon cluster creation.

Naming:

* might be renamed in the future \(data_api_..?\)

### `data_api_authorized_ip_ranges`

Use this to specify the range of source IP addresses allowed to reach the data API through the Internet.

*Default:* one item: `0.0.0.0/0`

*Value type:* list of strings

*Example:*

```yaml
data_api_authorized_ip_ranges:
    - 54.190.201.152/32
```

Locking this down makes sense when setting `data_api_authentication_disabled` to `true`.


### `cert_issuer`

Defines the issuer to use for all TLS-terminating certificates in the cluster, such as for the externally available data API endpoints.

*Default:* `letsencrypt-staging`

*Value type:* string, one of `letsencrypt-prod` and `letsencrypt-staging`

*Example:*

```yaml
cert_issuer: letsencrypt-prod
```

Note:

* `letsencrypt-staging` should be used for test cluster setups and playgrounds.
  This results in certificates that are not automatically trusted by browsers, i.e. users are likely to see security warnings.
* `letsencrypt-prod` results in browser-trusted certificates, but is subject to quota/limits so use it only when needed: [https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).


### `controller_image`

Defines the Docker image to run the controller from.

*Default:* controller image corresponding to the CLI build in use.

*Value type:* string -- Docker image reference, including the Docker hub user/org, the repository name, and the image tag (cf. example).

*Example:*

```yaml
controller_image: opstrace/controller:297005c9-ci
```

This defines the Docker container image based on which the Opstrace cluster installer deploys the so-called Opstrace cluster controller into the cluster \(as a Kubernetes deployment\).

Note that the controller does not get deployed into the cluster when initiating the cluster setup with the `--hold-controller` command line argument.
In that case, `controller_image` must still be set but is ignored.

Change this (compared to the default value) only when you know what you're doing :-).
