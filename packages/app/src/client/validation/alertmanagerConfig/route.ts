The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example, multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would be batched into a single group.

To aggregate by all possible labels use the special value '...' as the sole label name, for example: group_by: ['...']

This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs its own grouping.
