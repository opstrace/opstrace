# A scalable, secure, and open source Datadog alternative

Building and maintaining an open source observability stack based on the open source tools today is difficult.
Opstrace brings them together in a powerful wrapper so you can focus on what you do best.

Choosing the right way to monitor your software systems shouldn't be so hard and it shouldn't come with so many tradeoffs:

* SaaS vendors are easy, but expensive and take control of your data
* Open source provides control, but can require significant expertise and lacks ease-of-use
* Rolling your own provides ultimate control but requires (at least) several engineers to maintain and operate

Opstrace is the best way to run open source observability in your own cloud account, with the simple user experience of a typical SaaS vendor.

## Features

<!-- This list can either be 3, 5 or 6 items long. -->

* Scalable, long-term storage for your metrics and logs
* No vendor lock-in; leverage the best _open_ APIs and projects
* Retain control of your data by storing it in your own network
* A modern, collaborative analytic experience
* Up to 10x cheaper than typical SaaS

## Quick Start

## Opstrace Team

The Opstrace team came together to solve a pernicious, recurring problem we've seen over and over again: the unacceptable tradeoffs with observability.
We want to build the system we'd build for ourselves if it was our full-time jobâ€”and, well, now it is our full-time job!
