# Secure observability, deployed in your own network

Opstrace deploys secure, horizontally-scalable open source observability in your own cloud account, combining open APIs with the simple user experience of a large service provider.

Since **data never leaves your network**, it remains private.

With **authenticated multi-tenant APIs**, each team or environment can have their own protected sandbox to work with (tenants offer authorization and rate-limiting).

Storing data in your cloud provider's object store (e.g. S3) and exposing data retention primitives makes cost **controllable and up to 10x cheaper** than popular metered service providers.

## Quick Start

Want to kick the tires?
Spin up an Opstrace cluster in your own cloud account with our [quick start](https://go.opstrace.com/quickstart).

## Documentation

You can find the Opstrace documentation at [opstrace.com/docs](https://go.opstrace.com/docs).
We would also like to invite you to improve these docs together with us and have a [corresponding guide](./docs/guides/contributor/writing-docs.md) for that.

* Then review our [Development guide](./docs/guides/contributor/setting-up-your-dev-env.md) to learn how to set up your environment and build the code.
* If you'd like a place to start and get your feet wet, explore our [`getting started` issues](https://github.com/opstrace/opstrace/labels/getting-started), or reach out in [Discussions](https://go.opstrace.com/community).

There is of course a lot to do.
